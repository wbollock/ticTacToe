# Tic-Tac-Toe for Bash
Written by Will Bollock, wbollock

I thought it would be a fun challenge to write tic-tac-toe in Bash, a language I don't often see used for this type of task because of difficult array accessing/management and no multi-dimensional array support.

Note: buggy and slightly unfinished. Everything but win condition works right now.
